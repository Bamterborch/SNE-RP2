\chapter{Problem statement}\label{ch:problem}
Currently there is no way of testing applications to there limits without spending a lot of money on commercially available products. 
Since servers can be equipped with 40 and 100Gb/s NIC's, the OS and the application behind the NIC should be able to process the amount of traffic that comes in from the NIC. 
A wide variety of tools is available to generate traffic. Some of them offer an easy way of generating packets to put on the interface in order to fill up the bandwidth. 
Others are able to setup TCP sessions to transfer the traffic, but what tool to use for specific scenario's?   
Nikhef wants the ability to test the hardware they might buy up to OSI level 7, the application level . Until now they where not be able to go beyond layer 4. The purpose of this research is to find out what is needed to generated high volume session based traffic generation.

\section{Specifications}\label{sec:specifications}
\paragraph{Throughput}\mbox{}\\
Throughput is the most significant value for generating load. How to fill up the total capacity of the link. When using TCP there is some overhead.

\paragraph{Packets per second}\label{par:requnused}\mbox{}\\
When a link has a speed of 40Gb/s and packets have a size of 88bytes. This includes the interframe gap, the preamble and a VLAN tag. A maximum of 56.8 Million packets per second (Mpps) can be transferred over the link in one direction. When using a 100Gb/s line the theoretical maximum of packets per second (pps) is 142 Million.  

\paragraph{Sessions}\label{par:legitmoas}\mbox{}\\
\todo[inline]{Find out something about sessions}

\paragraph{Application specific traffic}\mbox{}\\
Different applications can be hosted, this research will focus on web applications. 
The average packet size of web traffic is around ....
\todo[inline]{fill in the size of average http traffic size}

\section{Research question}\label{sec:researchquestion}

\begin{center}
\textit{What is needed to perform high bandwidth session based throughput tests and how to go beyond pure network infrastructure testing?} \\
\end{center}
The term "high bandwidth" references to at least 40Gb/s. \\
The term "session based" references to TCP traffic. \\
