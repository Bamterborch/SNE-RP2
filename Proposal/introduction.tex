\section{Introduction}
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer high bandwidth links to customers to connect to the Internet. Dutch Universities and research facilities are able to connected with redundant 100Gb/s links to there ISP. 

Institutes like Nikhef (a tier 1 location for CERN) need to transfer large datasets and have to make calculations on the data. High uplink speeds are critical for research purposes. 

A hardware supplier like Juniper is offering hardware with high specifications for data center connectivity. Like a bandwidth of 40Gb/s per port and a maximum of 2 Billion packets per second. An example from Juniper for a QFX10k is given in the quoted part. \\ 

\say{The QFX10000 line of Ethernet switches provides cloud builders and data center operator switch scalable solutions for both core and spine data center deployments. QFX10002-36Q provides 2.88 terabytes of throughput and up to 2 billion pps of forwarding capacity. In native mode, QFX10002-36Q offers 36 ports of 40 gigabit QSFP+.} \\

Before buying hardware with these specifications a business has requirements for the system according to the role the hardware is going to fulfill. 
In high performance environments it matters if the system really lives up to its specifications. So this must be tested before the system goes into production. The goal of the research is a framework that allows for session based throughput device testing.
