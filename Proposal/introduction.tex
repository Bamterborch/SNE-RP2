\section{Introduction}
One hundred gigabit per second. In the world we live in this is a link speed you can get from you Internet Service Provider (ISP). When a business uses a link of 100Gb/s the security devices connected to this link also needs to be able to handle the traffic and apply security policies at least at this speed. Vendors offer machines with these capabilities. When looking at the specs of some vendors the maximum traffic is always represented in the form of Inter Mix (IMIX) traffic \cite{internetmix_2017}.
