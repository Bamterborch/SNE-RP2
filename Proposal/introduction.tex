\section{Introduction}
In the world we live in today a link speed of 100Gb/s  is a link speed you can get from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to connect to the Internet. 
Using Dense Wave Devision Multiplexing (DWDM) techniques, the ability to bundle multiple colors to create aggregated links with a capacity of 900Gb/s or more exist and are used. 
Businesses like Nikhef (a teer 1 location for CERN) need to transfer large amounts of data and have to make calculations on the data.
A hardware supplier like Juniper is a offering line card with enormous specifications, like a bandwidth of 40Gb/s and a maximum of 42 million packets per second.

Before buying hardware a business has some demands for the system according to the role the hardware is going to fulfil. In high performance environments it matters if the system really lives up to its specifications. So this must me tested before the systems go into production.
