\section{Ethics}
When creating a high bandwidth session based throughput testing environment with access to the Internet it is possible to perform DOS attacks on other environments. 
Therefore, all the tests will be performed on machines that are local and located inside the test environment. 
When this project is ready to be taken to the next level, the possibility exist to collaborate with contacts at different universities to perform some tests on production ready systems.
