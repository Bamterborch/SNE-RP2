\section{Project conditions}
This project is executed inside the test environment of Nikhef (labeled "speeltuin"). Nikhef is planning to replace the core router inside the "speeltuin", witch is used as an uplink for the test servers. When this happens during this research window at least a day of testing is lost. Besides that, the baseline of any throughput tests will be different with the newly installed hardware.
