\section{Project conditions}
To create a BGP hijack monitoring system that only uses public available information, we want to look into the possibility to read information from a software BGP router. Besides access to and knowledge of the BGP protocol and an opensource BGP routing software, we need computing resources to connect to BGP peers, process updates and perform the monitoring algorithm. Having access to full BGP routing updates is key for the success of this project. The University of Amsterdam provides room and equipment to the students where they can perform daily work.
