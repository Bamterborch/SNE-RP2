\section{Project conditions}
This project is executed inside the test environment of Nikhef (labeled "speeltuin"). The plan is to replace the core router that is used as an uplink for the test servers. When this happens during my research window I'll probably loose a day of testing. Besides that, the baseline of my tests will be different with the new hardware.
