\section{Research Question}

The NCSC would like to gain a near-real time insight in BGP hijacks concerning IP subnets of Dutch organizations, with a specific interest for government institutions.

\textbf{The research question is as follows:}\\
How to create an early detection system for BGP hijacks for a large number of IP-ranges and AS numbers with public resources? \\

\textbf{This question contains the following sub questions:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{What public resources are available that could be used to detect BGP hijacking, without disclosing IP prefix information?}
\item{How to detect BGP hijacks using this public information, with a low amount of false positives?}
\end{itemize}

At the end of the research, the NCSC would like to gain insight in the following question: What is the number of hijacks in the +/- 830 ASN's registred in RIPE with country code NL?
